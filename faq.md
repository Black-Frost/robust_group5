# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where will be the payload corrupted at?

It will be corrupted in physical layer. As its written on [challenger.md](./challenger.md), Jamming Machine will inject an electric shock directly to the LAN cable when its activated.

## Can we apply compression / encoding to the given data?

No. Any compressions, changing formats, encoding, etc... against the data is **NOT ALLOWED**.  
(Except the case that data size is same, or being bigger when its transmitted.)  
Purpose of this challenge is to "Design Robust Protocol that can communicate data even its connection is unstable.".  
Please understand that allowing them will change the goal and meaning of this lecture.

## Can we use external libraries to help for certain parts of the protocol?

Yes!! Any external libraries are allowed to use!!  
(Just be careful about license, if you are making your program available on the place such as GitHub after the competition.)

## Do you plan to support new programming language to implement a protocol?

If there are requests from multiple teams, we may consider adding new language.
